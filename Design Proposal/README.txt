Thank you for playing and supporting this game--GalaxyLegend!

This is the Term Project for fall 2017 15112 by Carl Yang. The term project folder contains all codes, images, and sounds that may be used in running the game.

The user should run compiler that has Python 3 environment to run the file named GalaxyLegend.py to play the game.

If you use Kinect to play, Visual Studio is recommended. You need to install the following modules in Visual Studio:

Anaconda 5.0.0 (32-bit) for Python 3.6
Comtypes
PyGame
PyKinect2

The player's bombs and lives left are displayed on the bottom left corner of the game screen. Scores are on the top of the screen.

If you only want to use keyboard, you can still use Viusal Studio to run. If you prefer other compiler, just comment those lines with Kinect. I mark them out in GalaxyLegend file.

About game control:

use arrow keys to change the position of the fighter, using space to shoot and 'b' to release a bomb. Just keep pressing these keys without leaving. You don't have to press and 
release and press again and again.

If you use Kinect, the game will track the movement of your righthand to control the movement of the fighter. You should raise your hand above a threshold to shoot, about 0.1 meter
from the plane of Kinect. You can use your left hand to draw circles to release bombs. Please draw large circles and don't draw small ones otherwise it is difficult for Kinect to track.
Stand about 1 meter from Kinect is recommended.

I use Photoshop to edit all the images. So if there are some warnings like unsupported png file, just ignore it. It does not affect game plaing. That's a PS issue!

Thank you for reading. I hope you have a enjoyable game experience.

Sincerely,

Carl Yang
